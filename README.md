## Better Together
Your challenge is to create a tool, app, or resource that helps close a gap that causes people to experience inequality. This combination of humanity and technology should eliminate or lessen a systemic issue and educate the user so they can grow.

## Summary
Our project is a tool to help people grow by learning to confront biased comments. Doing this changes thinking that perpetuates inequality.

## How we Addressed this Challenge
Our project is an exercise in addressing biased comments. It's important because people often feel uncomfortable confronting these types of statements, and this tool helps people practice. First, you can practice by reading scenarios and entering your response to each scenario. Then, you can compare your response with the suggested response. We hope this project is a starting point for reflection.

## How We Developed This Project
We were inspired to choose this challenge because we have a heart for eradicating inequality. We started with a team meeting where we verbally laid out what we wanted to achieve, then we created a kanban with user stories and routes. Our tech stack consists of JavaScript, Python, Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap. We deployed our website on Heroku. We encountered some hiccups when we ran into several git conflicts, but we were able to get together on zoom and iron them out as a team. We were excited to have the experience of coding as a team-- this was a first for many of us! In the future, we'd like to add user capability to the website so users can edit and delete their scenarios.
